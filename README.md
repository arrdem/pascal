# me.arrdem.pascal

This is a pure Clojure implementation of a pascal lexer, parser and symbol
table system. To build from source, perform the following steps:

1. chmod +x ./lein
2. ./lein self-install
3. ./lein uberjar

The jarfile produced by the lein uberjar operation will accept pascal code
either via stdin, or as a file argument. I sugest the invocation
`cat file.pas | lein run`
but
`java -jar target/me.arrdem.pascal-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar file.pas`
and
`cat file.pas | java -jar target/me.arrdem.pascal-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar file.pas`
will all invoke the same code which will read the input and attempt to generate
a valid internal representation from it for pretty-printing. 

Unfortunately, if the input is bad this parser/lexer pair will fail absolutely 
with horrific and utterly useless output.

## Output semantics
(comment & vals) 
    these groups are purely for debugging and are ignored

(progn & forms) 
    behaves as a control grouping operation, evaluates subsequent forms.

(goto <integer)
    behaves as one would expect, a goto to a (label) statement elsewhere.

(label <integer)
    behaves as one would expect, may be the target of (goto)s elsewhere.

(funcall identifier & args)
    behaves as one would expect and invokes a function with a fully qualified 
    name with the trailing arguments.

(:= identifier expr)
    assignment operator, +, -, *, / etc behave the same way.

## Qualified names and the symbol table
This symbol table is based on a hierarchy of nested tables which hide symbols
from lower levels as the semantics of functions, procedures and programs demand.
I present symbols for printing as fully-qualified paths, being a string
<base ns>.<child ns>.<2nd child ns>. ... /<symbol>
so for instance the constant d in graph1 is "toplevel.graph1/d" and soforth.
These semantics are used to note not only variables, but also functions with
functions such as "writeln" being special cases and declared _at_ the top 
level.

For your benifit the compiler is configured to debug the symbol table
_after_ it has dumped the generated IR as a table seperated from the code by a
line of "-" characters.

Please note that strings and literal values are replaced with generated symbols.
The string " " for instance is likely to be given a name such as 
toplevel.graph1/string_0. Because we will eventually have to compute a data 
segment, I have take the preemptive measure of interning strings and all other
constants in the symbol table for later optimization or simple inclusion. This 
behavior also holds for literals such as 1 and 32, for which integer variables 
with explicit values are created. Note that constants are typed to be refs to 
these generated variables rather than hold the value in and of themselves.
